<h1><img src="https://github.com/Opraks/Yumugo-Nfts/blob/main/What%20Icon.png?raw=true" alt="Örnek Resim"/> What Is Yumugo Nft's ?</h1>
- <b>Yumugo</b> is a friend egg. He is always a cheerful and sweet friend. During its creation, the focus was on what an egg could do. It was designed with <b>Pixel Art</b> techniques, <b>4096x4096px</b> in <b>PNG</b> size. Each one is a unique and singular example. Approximate file sizes are between <b>150Kb and 800Kb.</b> In its features, colors used and accessory information are available. 
- I wanted to set a reasonable price, I think this is enough to start with. I plan to develop <b>Yumugo v.2</b> after <b>Yumugo v.1</b> in the future. Lastly, I hope Yumugo brings you happiness...<b><i><u>by.opraks</u></i></b>

<h1><img src="https://github.com/Opraks/Yumugo-Nfts/blob/main/Starts%20Icon.png?raw=true" alt="Örnek Resim"/> How Did It Start ?</h1>
- I can start with the historical year <b>2024.</b> The inclusion of artificial intelligence and its products in the developing <b>Blockchain Technology</b> and the fact that it exhibits a new approach drew me directly to the drink as it was a subject I was already following.

- The <b>Yumugo</b> initiative developed spontaneously during this process. Although I have created many different ideas and models before, I chose to start with <b>Yumugo.</b> I expect positive contributions from you to make this idea successful and achieve something. Thank you all in advance. <b><i><u>by.opraks</u></i></b>
